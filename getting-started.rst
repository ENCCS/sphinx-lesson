Getting started
===============

From scratch
------------

You can get started by making a Sphinx project and configuring the
extension.  This is explained in the next page.

Demo lessons
------------

This guide can't currently stand alone.  It is probably better to see
and copy the real lesson demos to get started:

* The sphinx-lesson-template-empty template
  (https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template-empty) is
  currently the best empty repository to start from.  There is nothing
  here but the raw files you need.

* There is also sphinx-lesson-template
  (https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template) which is
  older and contains more examples in it.  This also means it is
  harder to use, because you have to delete more things.  Right now we
  recommend you use sphinx-lesson-empty.

* Github without the command line is a complete lesson using the
  theme: https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/ .
